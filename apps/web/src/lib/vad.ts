/**
 * Is anyone actually speaking?
 *
 * APP-54. Whisper always writes something. Hand it 118 seconds of a wok
 * and a music bed and it returns a confident page of English:
 *
 *     I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm
 *     going to be able to do it.
 *     I'm going to be doing it.
 *
 * Every rule in `cleanup.ts` passes that, and correctly — each line is
 * grammatical English with function words in it. The fault is not in any
 * line, so no rule that reads a line can find it.
 *
 * # Why a model and not a measurement
 *
 * The cheap answers were tried and measured first, and both fail:
 *
 * - **Loudness.** The clip is not quiet. It has music and cooking in it.
 * - **The syllabic band of the amplitude envelope** (3–9 Hz, where speech
 *   lives). Measured across four clips: the silent one scores 31.9%,
 *   between English at 29.6% and Chinese at 48.3%, and *above* Japanese
 *   at 19.9%. It would delete the Japanese subtitles and keep these.
 * - **Repetition in the transcript.** The no-speech clip repeats 80% of
 *   its four-word sequences against 0% for real narration, which looks
 *   decisive until it is tried on real speech that repeats: the same ten
 *   seconds of narration looped twelve times, and a song with a chorus,
 *   were both wrongly condemned by it.
 *
 * Silero VAD separates all six clips correctly, which is what earns it
 * its 2.3 MB:
 *
 *     no-speech cooking   0.0s of 118s     looped narration  45.8s of 131s
 *     English narration  66.7s of 116s     Chinese           115.5s of 120s
 *     Japanese           62.4s of 120s
 *
 * # The one thing it does not do
 *
 * Singing is not speech to it: a song with vocals scores 0.2 seconds.
 * That is the model's definition, not a bug, and it is why the caller
 * offers to transcribe anyway rather than refusing. A refusal would be
 * wrong about every music video.
