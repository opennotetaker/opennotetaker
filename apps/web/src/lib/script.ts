// describes arrived here too, on a 28-minute meeting: the same speaker
// came back Simplified in one line and Traditional in the next, dozens
// of times, and a reader who chose 简体 got neither.
//
// Whisper has one Chinese: `<|zh|>`. Which script it writes is decided by
// the audio and by nothing the caller can set, and it is not even
// consistent within a file -- measured on a bilingual news clip, one pass
// came back Traditional and the same speaker, re-read seconds later,
// came back Simplified. Half a transcript in each script is not a
// style, it is a fault.
//
// So picking 中文（简体）in the interface has to mean something, and the
// only place it can mean anything is here, afterwards.
//
// # Only one direction
//
// Traditional -> Simplified is very nearly one character to one
// character, which is what makes it safe to apply to a whole transcript
// without understanding a word of it. The reverse is not: Simplified 干
// is Traditional 干, 乾 or 幹 depending on the sentence, and a lookup
// table cannot choose. So a request for Traditional is left alone rather
// than answered wrongly.
