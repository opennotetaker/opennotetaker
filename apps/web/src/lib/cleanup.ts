// Taking out what the recogniser said but nobody spoke.
//
// Whisper is a *generative* model with a transcription task bolted on: it
// predicts likely text given audio, and when the audio holds nothing it
// can transcribe -- silence, applause, a music bed under the credits --
// it does not fall silent. It writes the most likely thing to appear in
// a subtitle file at that moment, because its training set was subtitle
// files scraped off the web, and those end with "Thanks for watching!",
// "ご視聴ありがとうございました", "字幕由Amara.org社群提供", and a Korean
// news reporter signing off.
//
// This is not a bug that can be fixed by decoding better. It is what the
// model is for. So the output is read afterwards, and the passages that
// cannot be a transcript of the audio underneath them are removed.
//
// # Why not a voice-activity detector
//
// The obvious answer -- gate on a VAD, drop anything over non-speech --
// is half of what happens here, and only half, because it does not hold
// up against the case that prompted it. End-credit music is not silence.
// It is often mixed at or above the level of the narration it follows,
// so an energy gate passes it and the model goes on writing over it.
// A neural VAD would tell speech from music, but it is a second model to
// download before the first one has finished.
//
// What is used instead is the level *and* the text, because these
// failures are identifiable by what they say:
//
//   1. It is in the wrong script for the language being read. Chinese
//      does not contain Korean sentences.
//   2. It is a word repeated. "you you you" is not English.
//   3. It is one of the model's known sign-offs, and there is no speech
//      under it.
//   4. It is the line before it, said again, over silence.
//
// And because debris does not always get a line to itself, a loop stuck
// to the end of a real sentence is cut off it rather than taking the
// sentence down with it.
//
// Each rule fires on something that is impossible rather than merely
// unusual, and each is the direct answer to a defect seen in the wild.

 * Joined, not dropped, because the content is real: deleting it would

/**

 *     └── どうでしたか ──┘                              └── どうでしたか ──┘
 *
 * — one phrase, twice, with a whole sentence between the two. Every rule
 * in this file lets it through, and it is worth saying exactly why,
 * because each of them is right to:
 *
 * - `stutterOf` wants the repeats *adjacent* and separated by spaces.
 *   Japanese has no spaces, and these are twenty characters apart.
 * - The whole-line duplicate test compares one line against another.
 *   This line is not a duplicate of anything; it contains one.
 * - `crammedRepeat` compares against the neighbouring cue, which does
 *   carry the middle sentence again — and scores 0.58 against a
 *   threshold of 0.60. It misses by two hundredths, because the two
 *   spellings differ: ときに in one and 時に in the other, the same word
 *   written two ways.
 *
 * So the shape this catches is narrow and specific: the line *ends* with
 * text it has already used. That is the decoder looping back to
 * something it emitted a moment ago, and the tail is the copy — the
 * first occurrence is where the phrase belongs, in the order it was
 * spoken.
 *
 * Only the tail is cut, never the earlier occurrence, and only when the
 * repeat is long enough not to be a coincidence. "はいはい" and a
 * genuinely repeated short word stay.
