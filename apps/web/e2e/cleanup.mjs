// Ported from opensubs (apps/web/e2e/cleanup.mjs), with src/lib/cleanup.ts.
//
// That file is opensubs' own plus 33 non-null assertions and nothing else. This
// app type-checks with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and opensubs does not, so
// every `texts[i]` inside a loop bounded by `.length` needed one; each was
// checked to be safe rather than added blind. To take a later opensubs fix:
// copy the file across, run `npx tsc --noEmit`, and put back the `!` it asks
// for. Anything else that differs is a real change and needs reading.
//
// The one section left out is opensubs' translation context, which tests a
// translator this app does not have.
//
// What the recogniser writes that nobody said, and what a translator is
// handed when a sentence is cut into three.
//
// These are unit tests, deliberately. The rules they cover were written
// against three videos this machine does not have -- an English, a
// Chinese and a Japanese clip that a team member ran and reported on --
// and the failures were quoted, not attached. What can be pinned down
// without the files is the rule: given this text, at this level, in this
// language, does the pass do the right thing.
//
// The audio level is injected rather than measured. Synthesised audio
// cannot stand in for a music bed under a voice-over, so pretending
// otherwise with a generated tone would be a test that passes without
// testing anything. The real waveform reaches these functions through one
// callback, and the callback is what the tests supply.
